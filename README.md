# REDUCE


Our tool called REDUCE (RElateDness of Ui ComponEnts) tends to provide MUI design restructuring operation in order to de-clutter 
overloaded MUIs andimprove the coherence of widgets labels. The newly proposed MUI should havea better semantic cohesion among all 
the widgets and a better widgets wording. REDUCE does not only detect semantically unrelated graphical componentsbut instead, 
it informs the existence of a low semantic cohesion design defect.
